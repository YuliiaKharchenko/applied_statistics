This repository contains all my work on the **Applied Statistics** module of the [ATU](https://www.atu.ie/) **Higher Diploma in Science in Computing in Data Analytics** course. The repository includes a series of module tasks as well as project implementation. The descriptions of the **tasks** and the **project** are provided [here](https://github.com/ianmcloughlin/2425_applied_statistics?tab=readme-ov-file#tasks-40).

# Getting Started

To get started to explore **project.ipynb** and **tasks.ipynb** on your local machine, follow the steps below:

## Prerequisites

- [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) 3.8 or higher
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) with the **Jupyter Extension** installed 

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-name>
   ```

2. **Install required libraries**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Open and run notebooks in VS Code**

1. Locate `project.ipynb` or `tasks.ipynb` in VS Code's file explorer and open the file.  
2. Select the Python interpreter for your local environment.  
3. Use the "Run Cell" (`â–¶`) buttons to execute cells sequentially.

# Usage Guide

## For data analysis

1. **Open the Jupyter notebooks**:  
  - Open `project.ipynb` to explore the detailed analysis of plant growth using t-tests and ANOVA.
  - Open `tasks.ipynb` to work through the tasks for the Applied Statistics module.

2. **Follow step-by-step instructions**:  
   - Each notebook contains detailed guidance on how to perform the analysis, including pre-testing for meeting the assumptions, statistical tests and visualisation.  

3. **Execute Code Cells**:  
   - Run the code cells sequentially to ensure correct outputs. 

## Important notes
- **environment setup**: Verify that your Python environment matches the requirements specified in `requirements.txt`.  
- **data file location**: The dataset, `PlantGrowth.csv`, is located in the `data/` directory and is preloaded in the notebook `project.ipynb` for analysis.  
- **results and outputs**: Visualization outputs, including statistical test results, are generated directly within the notebooks for review.
- **references**: All references used throughout the notebooks are provided as clickable links within the text for easy access.
